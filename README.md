	Single Player Hangman Version 1.0

	My single player hangman randomly picks a word or phrase from a game uses a txt library
	that the player needs to guess in order to win!

	Words can be added to library.txt so long as white spaces are not left on accident.

	Correct guesses don't count against total guesses.
